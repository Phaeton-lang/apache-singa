/// \section main_intro Introduction
/// Welcome to Apache Singa.
///
/// This documentation describes the **internal** software that makes
/// up SINGA, not the **external** use of  SINGA. There are no instructions
/// here on how to use SINGA, only the APIs that make up the software. For usage
/// instructions, please see the programmer's guide or reference manual.
///
/// \section Caveat
/// This documentation is generated directly from the source code with doxygen.
/// Since SINGA is constantly under active development, what you're about to
/// read is out of date! However, it may still be useful since certain portions
/// of SINGA are very stable.
